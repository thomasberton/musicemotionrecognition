To be born again
Wanting
The saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day

Waiting
For the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day

Aching
For your nails across my skin

But often more than not this is abused
And the faces of a tired generation
Have decided they are sick of being used
For the purpose of current declarations
Still the same, it'll never change until the end
Is to buy appreciation of the nation
To cover the mistakes you must defend
And you say there'll be a chance for ev'ryone
To proptest against your calculated greed
But I can see into the future
Won't be long before the welfare
Send me letters telling me how much they need
And it's not been in my interest to please them
For the only interest rate to fall is mine
See a brand new generation in demanding
What you've been doing without money all this time

Scam
People try living life at speed of light
Scam
Don't know why but I have to do the things I do
Scam
Give me ten, that's the move I give you five
Scam
People say it's the way to stay alive

So you see you have to be a schemer
If you wanna love the life you have to live
And it don't matter how much I earn
'Cause I always get my fingers burned
When the man gets down to his business
And I've been searching for a reason
Why I have to give it all up just when I want to get ahead
See I had to lose car, job, wife, dog and home
Debts and threats on the telephone
Maybe I should bust a move instead
Now we all know when we watch the television
Not confused between a puppet or conviction
Glued to the screen by a thousand shallow words of widsom
It ain't what it seems when it's a single sided system
Someone's got a hold on my living
So I'm gonna have to do the things that's fair
They got to justify for what I should be giving
Should I lie, should I steal or should I care
'Cause now I've got to scam"

I'm filled with sweet belonging
And Everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining
The sound of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

So many different places
A million smiling faces
Life Is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you
And how it is to touch you
Oh, paradise was made for you and me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

I know that life goes on just perfectly
Everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feel like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be

Oh, and in the nighttime
I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and tell you I love you so
To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with
And that is why I wanted you to know

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you
Without you."

The answer and the calls
Echo through the air

I reach for my guitar
Imagine where you are
And sing you
I sing you unto me
And you are there
Every note is sacred
Every word's a little prayer
As the blackbird's call
Or the last leaf's fall
I reach for my guitar
Imagine where you are
And sing you

He bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood
For a little confrontation.
He just a-let it all hang loose;
He didn't think about the noose.
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation.

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.

Now, Big Jim the chief
Stood for law and order.
He called for the guard to come
And surround the border.
Now, from his bulldog mouth,
As he led the posse south,
Came the cry, ""We got to ride
To clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters!""

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand.
No, no, no, no, no.

The account of the capture
Wasn't in the papers,
But you know, they hanged ol' Smack right then
Instead of later.
You know, the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker.

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand.
A shotgun in his hand.

In her arms I could be light

Before I was invisible
I thought I'd play it hard to get
Pretend I was unapproachable
But somebody else came along and
Took all the chances that I missed
Stuck on the sidelines
I keep thinking there she goes

Falling like rain
No I don't get to hold her tonight
Falling like rain
I was pushed to the back of the line
'Cause even though I need her love, and crave her touch
I guess I wasn't fast enough
She's falling like rain
Just not for me, not for me

Why I took the longest road
I'll have to plead insanity
It's like my pride put on a show
And didn't sell a single seat
While I was talking in riddles
Somebody else made perfect sense
Stuck on the outside
I keep thinking there she goes

What do you do
What do you say
When the best thing has passed you by
Where do you go
How do you know
If she'll come back another time

She's falling like rain - falling like rain
She's falling like rain - oh, oh, oh
She's falling like rain - falling like rain
She's falling like rain - she's falling
She's falling like rain"

That loves to lead you on
Say they got your number
But they never ever call
Like Eva the honey dip
Now I don't even wanna trip
Gave her my number
Her man gave me the fat lip
Now I don't bother calling anybody anymore
Sipping the finest
Chauffeur driven and I'm getting calls
555 ladies loves the cool Jay
No Mr Smith in this baby
Come and get the real thing

Now michelle got the body
Julie got the back
Lisa got the energy
To help me stay on track

Now I got digital and optical
I'm even on the net
I got mmm, ah, oh, I forget
'Cause nothing in this world
Like some sexual feeling
Toss it up baby
I'm ready willing receiving
Message understood
Loud and clear I'll be there
You got my number on your dial
Anytime anywhere
Whatever's clever mini skirts
High shoes or leather
Tonight's the night baby
Got to get some mo wetter

Girl you look so fine
Just call me anytime
You're tryin' to make me crazy
Can't get you out of my mind

TRAARXB128F92FA0BF,7,0,Megadeth,Blackmail The Universe,"(Mustaine)

This is breaking news
It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown and he is presumed missing
The Vice President, Secretary of State, and principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at DEFCON 3

The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I ""red, white and blew it""
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell

Nuclear battlefields energized
Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting
People lift up your fists in revenge

The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that ""Vietnam thing""

Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang
Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death

This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all of your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man

Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language - action
And he respects only one word - force
No sign of them stopping, no time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions, retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war

Blackmail the universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours

Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means
And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them
All along, only another region of hell"
TRABLYC12903CA72AD,7,0,Spleen United,Suburbia,"The city really loves you baby
But the city never really does
The feeling of corruption stays and
Then you think about the things you've lost

You've never really felt the fire
And you've never really felt the need
The city never stops you baby
And you remember how it feels to fall apart

You never really planned it baby
But then the planning never really stops and
When you think about the future baby
Then you dream about another start

It's the thing about illusions baby
It's the thing about the letting go
But the city never saves you baby
And you remember how it feels

To go away
To come back again

Everyone's a back door out

Even thought I had grown old enough to shy away from childish decisions
Keeping occupied with limited pleasure and hours of sorrow to hide
I'm burning alive every moment on fire everyday of my life

Tried facing the world one on one
Yet fairness has always remained unknown
Letting go

Changing inside hidden by my expressions on the outside
Praying that sunrise will brighten the darkness of a once peaceful mind
Sleepless again drenched in sweat pillows collapse with sheets to shed the fragile wood
Frame bends beneath my head

This knife stuck in my side crooked and wide
The blocking of blood steal bone collide
Leaving me helpless completely defenseless
My access denied [x4]

Who was it that said all wounds will heal
Guess they were never ill
Explanations only for some of us
How close can one come to the doorstep of death?
Before the bell is rung
A few already know... already know

My time alone was well spent but now seems wasted
Even thought I had grown old enough to shy away from childish decisions
Keeping occupied with limited pleasure and hours of sorrow to hide

When the sky turns black and nature's sounds go mute

In the flickering sway of the sun's last ray

Blowing storm out of hand

TRABGMX128F421B988,7,0,Dragonforce,Operation Ground And Pound (Album Version),"Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the Evil One on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Soldiers searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torture in the winter skies, riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain

Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the cross, destroy the army
Crush the legions of the twilight
Templars of steel will burn

Cry far away, as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world, as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes, praying that I'll see you all

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Watch you die, I watch you die inside 
While fear controls your life
Then reject this animosity
That kills so many minds
We feel the power deep within
The fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason 
Now, you will be mine

Screams of pain and death descending
Rise again from hell defending 
Burn their hearts within the fire
Warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day, but the memories never change
Stand before the storm, as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside
The chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight"

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin' sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their Spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again &amp; again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you &amp; I'll be twins

Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone"
